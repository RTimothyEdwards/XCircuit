Compilation/Installation notes:
(Online version at http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/install.html)

1) All compile-time features are set during the ./configure process.
   Run "./configure --help" for a list of configure options.  For most
   users, the relevant options are the following:

   --with-cairo		Enable cairo graphics

   --with-tcl		Configure xcircuit as an extension to Tcl/Tk.  Tcl
			becomes the default interpreter.  Option is mutually
			exclusive with "--with-python".  A feature of this
			version is that the interpreter is available from
			the calling terminal concurrently with the GUI.
			Another feature of this version is that the graphics
			are handled by Tk widgets instead of the troublesome
			"Xw" widgets in the distribution.  As of version
			3.1.7 where most of the bugs have been resolved,
			use of this option is highly encouraged.

   --with-python	Configure xcircuit with the embedded Python
			interpreter.  Option "--with-python" is disabled
			by default, and has no effect if "--with-tcl" has
			been selected.  The python interface is less
			well-developed than the Tcl interface.  If you do
			not intend to make use of the interpreter
			command-line interface, there is probably no reason
			to select this.

   --prefix=PREFIX	Location to install xcircuit.  Defaults to
			/usr/local/.  The executable goes to /usr/local/bin/,
			man pages to /usr/local/man/man1/, and everything
			else to /usr/local/lib/xcircuit-VERSION/.  Defaults
			can be separated by explicitly declaring
			--exec-prefix=DIR, --mandir=DIR, and --libdir=DIR.

   The following option is experimental at present and will be changed to
   be enabled by default when the package is deemed stable:

   --enable-asg		Configure XCircuit with the automatic schematic
			generation (ASG) package.  This package allows
			XCircuit to read SPICE decks and produce schematics
			from them.  Future functions include reading EDIF
			netlists (from Verilog and/or VHDL), and automatially
			routing layouts.

   The following options are probably not worth messing with:

   --disable-lgf	Save space by not compiling the compatibility with
			"analog" and "diglog" .lgf-format files.

   --disable-schema	Don't compile the schematic capture system.  This
			is a major feature of xcircuit, so disabling it is
			not recommended.  However, you may do so if you
			anticipate having no need for circuit netlists.

   There are some other options which can be supplied to the "configure"
   command-line which should only be needed in rare circumstances.  Most
   users can ignore these.

   --with-tcl=DIR	Tcl can be enabled with "--with-tcl" or
			"--with-tcl=yes", and the Tcl library and include
			directories will be automatically searched.  For
			Tcl/Tk installations which cannot be found by the
			automatic search, DIR should be the directory
			containing "tclConfig.sh".

   --with-tk=DIR	Enabling Tcl for XCircuit implies "--with-tk".
			However, for Tk installations which cannot be
			found by automatic search and which cannot be
			found by specifying "--with-tcl=DIR", DIR should
			point to the directory containing "tkConfig.sh".

   --with-python=DIR	If the configure step cannot find a Python
			interpreter, it can be explicitly referenced.
			Requires the Python library (libpythonVERSION.a
			or libpythonVERSION.so) and the python include
			file Python.h.  The Python option uses the Python
			language as an interpreter for xcircuit.

   --disable-double-buffer
			This option is almost wholly deprecated due to the
			speed of modern processors.  However, if you have
			problems with slow rendering, you might find it
			useful.

   --with-xpm=DIR	If the configure step cannot find the XPM package,
			it can be explicitly referenced.  The XPM package
			enables the toolbar and an icon when xcircuit is
			iconified.

   --with-gs=DIR	If the configure step cannot find ghostscript,
			it can be explicitly referenced.  The Ghostscript
			option allows any PostScript file to be rendered
			on the xcircuit background and saved with the
			xcircuit file.

   NOTE:  When xcircuit went from "imake" to GNU make, the default install
   directory changed from /usr/local/lib to /usr/local/share/.  Since all
   the other CAD tools xcircuit works with install by default to
   /usr/local/lib, xcircuit version 3.1 has reverted to /usr/local/lib for
   reasons of compatibility.  See item (4) below, "uninstall".

2) Compile with the usual GNU-compile steps:

	./configure
	make
	make install

   The final step must be done as root if you are installing to default
   locations (/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/bin).  XCircuit can be run
   in test mode before installation (see item (3), below).
   For the Tcl/Tk version the make steps are the same, assuming that
   Tcl/Tk libraries and include files can be found on the system.  If
   you specifically *don't* want the Tcl/Tk version, then do:

	./configure --without-tcl
	make
	make install

   If you want to test before installing, do the following (csh/tcsh
   version; see item (3) for changes to line 4 for bash/ksh/sh):

	./configure
	make
	setenv XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR ./lib
	setenv XCIRCUIT_SRC_DIR ./lib/tcl
	lib/tcl/xcircuit.sh

   after which, if all goes well, you can do "make install".

3) NOTE:  To test xcircuit before installation, set environment variable

	setenv XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR ./lib		(csh, tcsh)
	setenv XCIRCUIT_SRC_DIR ./lib/tcl

	export XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR=./lib		(bash)
	export XCIRCUIT_SRC_DIR=./lib/tcl

   before running the xcircuit executable.

4) Uninstall:
   If you have compiled previous versions of xcircuit, the only thing you
   need to do to uninstall these versions is to remove the directory tree
   at /usr/local/share/xcircuit-(version) or /usr/local/lib/xcircuit-(version)
   for any version numbers which are not current.

5) HP/IRIX users:  If the "make" process dies with an error creating the man
   page, something like

      /usr/ccs/bin/m4:xcircuit.1.m4:911 more than 4096 chars of argument text

   be sure to use GNU m4.  This can be done during the configure process
   (using appropriate substitutions) with the following command:

      M4=<path to GNU m4> ./configure [options]

6) 64-bit system users: Proper compile may require specifically using
   configure option "--x-libraries=" to point to 64-bit libraries.
   This has been fixed for the AMD Opteron under Fedora Core;  other
   64-bit systems are untested.

7) aclocal problems: In case during the make process the system complains
   about a missing or out of date aclocal, rebuild the configure file with:

      autoreconf -fi

   And restart the ./configure command

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shared Python Library:

   NOTE:  The XCircuit build will be *much* smaller if you have a shared
   python library.  However, the build instructions as of Python-2.1c2
   don't include instructions for building a shared library under linux.
   Here's how you do it:
	1) In the Makefile: set
		LDLIBRARY=libpython2.1.so
	2) Also in the Makefile:
		Add a case for libpython$(VERSION).so which looks
		exactly like the case statement for unixware:

        	linux) \
            	    $(LDSHARED) -o $@ $(LIBRARY_OBJS) \
            	    ;; \ 

	3) Make until error (can't find libpython2.1.so)
	4) Copy or move libpython2.1.so to /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib
	5) Run (as root!) ldconfig -v -n /usr/local/lib  (or whereever
		you just put the shared library) and confirm that it
		found libpython2.1.so.
	6) Finish "make" (should run to normal completion).

   On my system, this is the difference between a 4MB xcircuit executable
   and a 1.5MB executable.  That's a big difference!  Of course, Python
   purists would say I should be embedding xcircuit in python, not the
   other way around, then what need do I have for a shared library,
   anyway?

   Python source (and other information relating to Python) can be found
   at www.python.org.  The Python interpreter is recommended, as XCircuit
   eventually will rely on Python to handle writing netlists, for
   flexibility in formatting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extras:

   The file examples/.xcircuitrc shows how to make a home-directory file
to alter the behavior of xcircuit on startup.  It shows how to change the
color scheme, add new fonts, override the default libraries, and change
the editing behavior for polygons.  Note that if xcircuit is built with
embedded Python, the syntax for .xcircuitrc will be Python syntax, and
may use any Python commands in addition to the commands which hook into
xcircuit functions.  The file examples/test.py is a sample Python script
which features use of Python to create animated graphics within the
xcircuit window, shows how to access on-screen elements and change
their properties, and contains convenience function definitions for
manipulating xcircuit elements.

   Other files in the examples directory show how xcircuit can be
used to draw various things, from a simple circuit schematic
(vcoblock.ps) to an entire publishable-quality page of music 
(prelude.ps), plus an example of a fancy page border for slide
presentations.

   The files psfiles/signal.lps and psfiles/musiclib.lps are examples
of alternate or additional object libraries.  The library file lgf.lps
is used primarily by the lgf-to-ps conversion routines, but has some
different circuit objects in it.

   The file psfiles/fonttest.ps is a short PostScript program you can
use to get your printer to give you the names of all the built-in fonts
that it knows about, which is useful because if you add a font name to
xcircuit, the spelling has to be exactly correct or else the printer
won't recognize it.

   The file examples/gettext.py is a sample Python script which adds
a Python command called "gettext(filename)".  gettext(filename) reads
in file "filename", which should be an ASCII text file, and turns it
into a label in XCircuit positioned at the cursor position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

X Resources:

   The Tcl/Tk version of XCircuit does not use the X resources but
picks up resources from the file "resource.tcl" in the run-time
library path (e.g., /usr/local/lib/xcircuit-3.8/resource.tcl).  The
resource names are the same as those described below but are specified
using the Tk "option add" command.

   The color scheme of xcircuit has a default setup, but accepts 
alternate color schemes using the following keywords which can be put
in the X Defaults (.Xdefaults, .Xresources) file:

   Resource name	    Description				Default
   -------------------      ----------------------------        -------
   xcircuit*foreground	    color of buttons and popups;	White
   xcircuit*background	    background of buttons & popups;	DarkSlateGray
   xcircuit.foreground	    drawing area foreground;		White
   xcircuit.background	    drawing area background;		Black
   xcircuit*gridcolor	    color of the grid lines;		Gray40
   xcircuit*snapcolor	    color of the snap-to points;	Red
   xcircuit*selectcolor	    color of a selected object;		Gold
   xcircuit*querycolor	    to differentiate multiple objects;  Turquoise
   xcircuit*axescolor	    color of the x, y axes;		NavajoWhite4
   xcircuit*offbuttoncolor  text color of an inoperable button; Gray70
   xcircuit*auxiliarycolor  text cursor and other things	Green
   xcircuit*barcolor	    color of panning bars		Tan

A secondary color scheme (for example, black-on-white) can be specified by
adding "2" to each of the above resource names.  For example:

   xcircuit*foreground2	    color of every object drawn;	Black
   xcircuit*background2	    screen background color;		White

Other resources accepted by xcircuit are:

   xcircuit*width	    width of the drawing area (pixels);	600
   xcircuit*height	    height of the drawing area;		500

Normally, you will want to put the defaults in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.
If you do not have root access, you will want to have them in your own
home .Xdefaults file.  If the file is not found by xcircuit, the program
will use its default color schemes, the main one being black-on-white,
and the alternate being white-on-dark-gray.
